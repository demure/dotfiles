#Demure's Dotfiles  

This is a repo of my dot files, to help me keep them organized,  
and in-sync between computers and servers.  

I am in the *long* process of revamping all of my files, adding useful plugins,  
organizing snippets, improving comments, and trying making one conf work for  
all my systems (when/where possible).  

**NOTE:** While I am currently continuing to maintain the [github] repo,  
I have moved to [gitorious]. Repo link in top comments, of most comment-able confs.  

###Install:

Aside from installing by hand, you could use [GNU Stow].

###Improved:  

* I think my vimrc has improved a good deal ^__^  
    * It will now auto install Vundle if missing, and create undo/backup/swap paths **8APR2013**  
    * Now updated for new vundle syntax **16NOV2014**  
* My PS1 is much simpl.... Err, neater? **25APR2013**  
    * The machine test is much more consise, and the git check quite useful  
* Bashrc is now broken up into sub sourced files, much more orginzation potential **26MAY2013**  
* Moved to the spectrwm window manager **~18MAY2014**  
* Killed off my laptop's useless menu key, and now have a `SUPER_R` **21MAY2014**  
* Added test and variable for missing items in bash **12NOV2014**  
* Decided to declare my `$PATH` with everything I want **12NOV2014**  
* Added a MISSING_ITEMS to check if disabled things disabled **13NOV2014**
* Added [GNU Stow] for installing **06MAR2014**

###Plans:  

* For tmux, I am still debating to use powerline or not...  
    * One of the annoying issues is that the current beta seems pretty confusing

**PS.** If you happen to have advice, I certainly would be interested in ways to
improve my setup.  
If you do wish to contact me, I guess [twitter] is an ok way (spam mitigation)
