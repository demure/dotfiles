#Demure's Dotfiles
This is a repo of my dot files, to help me keep them organized, and in sync.

I am in the process of revamping all of my files, adding useful plugins,
organizing snippets, commenting, and making one conf work for all my systems.

######Improved:
I think my vimrc has improved a good deal ^__^
It will now auto install Vundle if missing, and create undo/backup/swap paths.

######Plans:
For tmux, I am still debating to use powerline or not...
If I do decide I like it, I will probably try vim-powerline as well.
One of the annoying issues is that the hacked fonts for mac don't look very good
without anti-aliasing... And I don't like to use anti-aliasing...

<BR>
**PS.** If you happen to have advice, I certainly would be interested in ways to
improve my setup.
