## This is heavily inspired by Mark H. Nichols's post
# http://zanshin.net/2015/01/19/teaching-a-homely-mutt-new-tricks/

# which in turn was inspired by Steve Losh's post

# Aside from using my accounts, and eventually a few tweaks,
# I am /not/ using OS X's keychain...
# I am using pass now, which is working quite well
