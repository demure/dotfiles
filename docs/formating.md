        # ...and its second line
        some code


#### Same Line as Code ####

* Two comment symbol and a space
* Tab comments evenly inside of code block
    * Preferably matching highest block relevant

        some code           ## Some comment
        some more code      ## Another comment


#### Toggling Code ####

* Comment symbol directly preceding code, to toggle it out

        #echo "some text"       ## Toggled off
        other code              ## Still active

* Long sections can have comment symbol at beginning of line

        #       if
        #           blah
        #         else
        #           blah blah
        #       fi

* Temporary comments may use three, or more, comment symbols
    * May also be use to distinguish between example conf comments

        ###some code            ## disabled for troubleshooting
        other code
        #another line           ## disabled


### Indentation: ###
#### Overall Indents ####

* Child Blocks will be indented one further than parent
* Neighboring Blocks will be on the same indent level

        ### Another Block ### {{{
        other content
        ### End Another ### }}}


#### 'if' Test Indents ####
* Code will be indented one further than 'if'
* Half indent 'else's... because I like it.

        if
            first
        else
            second
        fi


### Line Spacing: ###

            other content
            ### End Nested ### }}}
        ### End Parent ### }}}

    * Comment lines used for details/description need not

        if other_test
            echo "for demonstrating below"
        fi
